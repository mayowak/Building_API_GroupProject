# Predict Titanic Survivors

This is a contributed project that builds an API that predicts Titanic survivors given the following columns `Pclass`, `Sex_male`, `Age`, `Fare`, `Embarked_Q`, `Embarked_S`.  
The project made use of the popular titanic dataset which can be gotten from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Akawi85/Building_API_GroupProject/main/datasets/titanic.csv).

In order to execute this project on your local machine, you are expected create a python 3 virtual environment ([see how here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19IpozHrM38HzVSI4PjwRFJSNeLdcceUKg98fr2Db-DQ/edit)) and have pip installed in your environment. You are also expected to install all the necessary modules and libraries using pip in the `requirements` text file.  

To perform prediction:
- run the `api.py` script and click on the local host link
- this takes you to a html page, where you are expected to train the first by clicking the `Train Model` button
- after training the model input values in the form fields and click the `Predict` button.
- You can also get the top view, bottom view or basic information of the dataset used for training the model, by clicking `Top view`, `Bottom view` or `Show dataset info` respectively.
